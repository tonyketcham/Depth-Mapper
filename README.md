<h1>Depth Mapper</h1>

[WIP] Generates a depth map from a focal stack of images. Supports Jpeg, soon to support DNG.

Makes use of OpenCV and an enhanced Java implementation of ExifTool.

<h2> Installation </h2>

A Maven Eclipse project is provided. Make sure you have OpenCV 4.1.1 installed as a User Library in eclipse as 'opencv'. The project should function with earlier versions of OpenCV as well, however it has not been tested.
